# Code use the collections namedtuple to five out avg. Program reads input from STDIN

# Task

# Dr. John Wesley has a spreadsheet containing a list of student's ID, MARKS, NAME and CLASS.

# Your task is to help Dr. Wesley calculate the average marks of the students.

# Note:
# 1. Columns can be in any order. IDs, marks, class and name can be written in any order in the spreadsheet.
# 2. Column names are ID, MARKS, CLASS and NAME. (The spelling and case type of these names won't change.)

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer N, the total number of students.
# The second line contains the names of the columns in any order.
# The next N lines contains the ID, MARKS, NAME and CLASS. under their respective column names.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
