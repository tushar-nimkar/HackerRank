# Code reads input frm STDIN below is the explanation:

# Task:
# Raghu is a shoe shop owner. His shop has X number of shoes.
# He has a list containing the size of each shoe he has in his shop.
# There are N number of customers who are willing to pay xi amount of money only if they get the shoe of their desired size.
# Your task is to compute how much money Raghu earned.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from collections import Counter
number_of_size=int(input())
shoes_available = Counter(list(map(int, input().split())))
customer =int(input())
profit=0
for shoe in range(customer):
    new_entry = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if shoes_available[new_entry[0]] >0:
        profit += new_entry[1]
        shoes_available[new_entry[0]]-=1
print(profit)

# Input:
# 10 --> no. of sizes available in following list
# 2 3 4 5 6 8 7 6 5 18
# 6  --> no. of customer entries in below
# 6 55
# 6 45
# 6 55
# 4 40
# 18 60
# 10 50

# Output:
# 200

# Explaination:
# Customer 1: Purchased size 6 shoe for $55.
# Customer 2: Purchased size 6 shoe for $45.
# Customer 3: Size 6 no longer available, so no purchase.
# Customer 4: Purchased size 4 shoe for $40.
# Customer 5: Purchased size 18 shoe for $60.
# Customer 6: Size 10 not available, so no purchase.

# Total money earned 55 + 45 + 40 + 60 = 200
